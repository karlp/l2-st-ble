Do note that this project includes:

And.. Importantly...
* ST's STM32_WPAN middleware.  It has it's own license. (SLA0044)

That's the main one that will give you some concern, however, as this project is about STM32WB, 
so Clauses 2 and 4 is basically covered.

Well, and clause 5, but, well, as long as you're not trying to _claim_ their code, I don't think
that's an issue.
